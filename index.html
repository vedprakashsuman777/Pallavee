                        <h1>Hello Pallavi Ma'am</h1>
                        <p> Let me start from wishing you good morning. I hope you will be reading it in morning else evening you can consider.
                            Just from the day we first met, That day I was quite nervous because of my expectations and even the moment when I looked into your eyes I was speechless.
                            That was seems to be like dream comes true.I got all my sense back with first question to define myself, I was blank and tried best to express myself.
                            With all those indeed points I feel like its a great match for having same kind of perspective.Still I remember those response like child of achieving something, the way you thumps down and saying "Sahi Hai" and "Same".
                            I was getting that time good vibe, something more supportive kind of which may be makes things ease.
                            </p>

                        <h1>Uff!!! Chilly Flakes</h1>
                        <p>
                            Do you know Chilly Flakes are actually not that much spicy than chilly ?In the same way, you are actually kind hearted and cool minded person and it doesn't mean that you won't be angry anymore.
                            You have great potential and patience. I need to learn these from you. I seems to be cool like Oregano but somehow I may react like spices. Overall we all need both of these into our life to maintain the balance.
                            Then only our life which can be relatable as Pizza becomes delicious. There might be some difference in daylight but in the moonlight we'll be sharing all of us. From thoughts to same roof where we would be talking by staring at the stars.

                            Usually at many stages we think we are enough capable of things arround us.But we aren't just because we don't know that what exactly we are unaware of.
                            With you Pallavi, I am sure that everyday I would be learning something new from you. The art of living where you have the inner clock to wake up and sleep early.
                            Everyday thinking of "Acche se kosis karte hai, baaki jo hoga dekha jayega" which keeps you motivated and the key "Kya hi karna hai abhi soch ke, jab samay aayega dekha jayega" does the stopper role in overthinking.
                            I really appreciate the control you have on your emotions. That's tremendous !!! and you are the ocean of qualities. Btw I won't give any fees of learning these qualities from you. Hahhaa

                            That's really not so funny I know "Palla"+"Ve" but I like it.Always I want smile in your face and I will be trying to make my jokes better like the past iPhone example.
                            I know am not that much serious type of person but you are and we need mixture of both.Still somewhere all need someone to be there to listen us. I wish it could be lucky me.
